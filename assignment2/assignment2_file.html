						<h3 id="paraTitle">This is Why the 1990's was the Best Era of Anime</h3>

	          <p> Japanese animation has been around for almost a century. Which beggs the question: Why would this.
							Econ Major who can't draw fingers, would say that animation from  1990s is better than the likes of
							"Attack on Titan" and "Jujutsu Kaisen" today. Well, there is more than just millenial nostalgia behind
							this take. I promise! First,	From an art point of view, 1990s anime offer a great diversity in the
							type of art style being used. The choice of colors and backgrounds also
							variated greatly: you had cyberpunk settings such as in "Ghost in the shell,"
							90s Japanand aesthethics and fashion in the form of Yuyu Hakushow, and 1990s
							basketball and hip hop influence with Slam Dunk. During the late 80s and the begining ofthe 90s,
							independent studios had investment flowing left, right, and center; this
							would translate on greater resources, and creative freedom to make high quality content
							with less coporate oversight. This allow artist to explore their
							creativity, while writers could take greater risk in their story
							telling. The end result was, what I would argue is the gold age of anime. </p>

	          <p>Therefore, the question is: What happened to Japanese anime? Well,
	          the answer lies on a series of factors. First, the finantial crisis of
	          the 1990s lead to increase fiscal responsability on the part of Japanese
	          companies, including anime studios. There was also the increased quality of Western
	          animation, which was contraste withe the slow adoption of new technologies in Japan, such as 3-D animation;
	          leading higher cost of production than their competion. Addtionally, one has to mention the mentality
						of many Japanese companies, where the entire world market is ofen ignored.
						While anime was incredibly poplular in the late 90s, and early 2000s in Europe and Latin America; Japanese
						studios ignored the entire foreign market and lost billions of dollars in potential revenue, that could have help Japanese animation studios
						stay afloat and even venture  early into 3-D animation. Eventually, many studios went bankrupt, and strict fiscal responsability
	          took over. Which resulted in studios becoming more risk adverse. Eventhough today the anime
						and manga represent worth over 20 billion USD, you just have to wonder, what would have happened had Japanese
					  animation companies gambled in the 90s and decided to go internal.</p>
