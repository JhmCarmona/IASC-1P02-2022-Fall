						<h3 id="paraTitle">This is why the 1990's was the best era for anime</h3>

	          <p>In this paragrpah I will describe why 90s animes are the best. first
	             From an art point of view, 1990s anime offer a great diversity on the
	             art style being used. The use of colors variates greatly, and
	             independent studios had more freedom to create high quality content
	             with less coporate oversight. This allow artist to explore their
	             creativity, while writers could take greater risk in their story
	             telling.</p></br>

	          <p>Therefore, the question is: What happened to Japanese anime? Well,
	          the answer lies in a series of factors. First, the finantial crisis of
	          the 1990s lead to increase fiscal responsability on the part of Japanese
	          companies, including anime studios. The increase quality of Western
	          animation, and slow adoption of new technologies lead many Japanese
	          companies to have a higher cost ofmproduction than the competion.
	          Eventually, many studios went bankrupt, and strict fiscal responsability
	          took over. Now writters and animators had to proof that their ideas,
	          would find a market.</p>
