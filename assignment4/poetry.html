        					<p> The following is one of my favorite poems. It was written by <br>
        					famous British writter Ruyard Lord Alfred Tennyson.<br>
        				  It depicts  a military engagement in the Crimean war where <br>
                  a bigade of British cavarymen  charged against a vastly <br>
                  supperior Russian force, facing imminent death, showing<br>
        				  insurmountable courage. This poem tells of the bravery from <br>
                  these men.</p>

        					<p>This is not a poem to glorify war, but rather honours the deaths<br>
        					of these men. It was also used as a critique by people during the<br>
        				  the late 19th century regarding the poor leadership of the British<br>
        				  Army officers who would send their men on suicide missions.</p><br>

                         Someone had blundered.<br>

                      Stormed at with shot and shell,<br>
                      Boldly they rode and well,<br>
                      Into the jaws of Death,<br>

                      Flashed as they turned in air<br>
                      Sabring the gunners there,<br>
                      Charging an army, while<br>
                      All the world wondered.<br>
                      Plunged in the battery-smoke<br>

                      Cossack and Russian<br>

                       Shattered and sundered.<br>
                      Then they rode back, but not<br>

                      They that had fought so well<br>
                      Came through the jaws of Death,<br>
                      Back from the mouth of hell,<br>
                      All that was left of them,<br>
