  <p>     Fighting in Donbas escalated after 17 February 2022.[121] Ukraine and separatists in the Donbas each
    accused the other of firing across the line of conflict.[122][123] On 18 February, the Donetsk and Luhansk people's
    republics ordered emergency evacuations of civilians,[124][125][126] though a BBC analysis found that the video
    announcing the "emergency" evacuation had been filmed two days prior to its purported date.[127] There was a sharp
    increase in artillery shelling by the Russian-led militants in Donbas, which was considered by Ukraine and its allies
    to be an attempt to provoke the Ukrainian army or create a pretext for invasion.[128][129][130] On 19 February both
    separatist republics declared full mobilisation.[131]

    In the days leading up to the invasion, the Russian government intensified a disinformation campaign intended to mute
    public criticism. Russian state media promoted fabricated videos (many amateurish)[132][133] that purported to show
    Ukrainian forces attacking Russians in Donbas; evidence showed that the purported attacks, explosions, and evacuations
    were staged by Russia.[134] On 21 February, the head of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said that Russian
    forces had killed five Ukrainian "saboteurs" that had crossed into Russian territory, captured one Ukrainian serviceman
    and destroyed two armoured vehicles. Ukraine denied this, and warned that Russia sought a pretext for an invasion.
    The Sunday Times described it as "the first move in Putin's war plan".[135][136]</p>
