		</div>

		<div>
			<p>While a <em>variety of theories</em> have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now<br />
				accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning <em>"village"</em> or <em>"settlement"</em>.[9]<br />
				In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer<br />
				Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that<br />
				particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European<br />
				books and maps had begun referring to this region as Canada.[10]<p>

			<p>In the 17th and early 18th centuries, <strong>"Canada"</strong> referred to the part of New France that lay along the St.<br />
				Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada<br />
