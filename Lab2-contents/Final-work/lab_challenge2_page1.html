			<p>In this section of my website, I would like to introduce you to<br />
				some absolutely ridiculous text that will work as a mere filler.</p><br />

			<p style="font-size:29"><em><strong>The Rise and Downfall of The Reddit Edgelords!</strong></em></p><br />

			<p>Reddit is known as one of the best, and worse websites known to men. In a way it is the biggest<br />
				collection of online communities in the internet. You can find a community (or subrredit) for pretty much anything,<br />
				which is awesome! For Example, if you are 17 and want to find a girlfriend, but you have no idea how<br />
				to talk to girls, you can ask the community on a subreddit for tips. Sure, most of the cats, there<br />
				have no idea what female is, and wether or not you can get them on a lootbox. There is also the change<br />
				you get called a "virgin looser" by a Virgin Looser who lives on his mom's basement, but that's part<br />
				of the charm.</P><br />

        <P>There are also useful subreddits, like "r/financial independence" where you can get real life advice<br />
				on personal finance. However, you can also find some of the biggest weirdos on the internet, censorship-prone<br />
				moderators, and tons of criminal activity in hidden subrredits. So the question is: is reddit trutly that<br />
				bad? (The answer is yes, but I have to keep writting a little bit longer xd). One argument is that the<br />
				platform's job is to maintain it's servers and enable users to partake in their desired subreddits, and<br />
				only intervene, in cases that are considered an overreach of the user's agreement. To this end, Reddit<br />
				delegates the basic mantainance of a subreddit to moderators, who are member's of the user community who's<br />
				job is to detter bad behaivour and intervene when necessary.</p>

				<p>It is precisely said moderators who are one of reddit's biggest sources of controversies.<br />
					Moderators have the ability to delete post, report users (and kick them out if necessary),<br />
					as well as ensure all of the community guidelines are followed. On paper this is a good<br />
					thing. However, more often than not, such moderators tend to abuse of their power to<br />
					censore views that are different to their own; or even protect questionable, and sometimes<br />
					illegal behaiviour.</p>

				<p>Finally, I wrote enough about reddit to make this count as a dummy text.<br />
