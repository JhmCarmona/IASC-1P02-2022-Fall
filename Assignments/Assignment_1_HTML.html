			<p>On April 23, 1910, <em>Theodore Roosevelt</em> gave one of the most popular speaches in his career.<br />
				The former president stopped in Paris on April 23, and, at 3 p.m. at the Sorbonne, before a<br />
				crowd. The speach that gave would be called <strong>"Citizenship in a Republic,"</strong> but many people would<br />
				come to know it as: <strong><em>"The man in the Arena."</em></strong> President Roosevelt was well-known for his spirit as<br />
				public servant, and during his tenure as president of the United Stated he continued that<br />
				tradition.</p>

      <p>The most popular sport in Canada is <strong>hockey</strong>, along with some of the Baltic countries.The sport also<br />
				remains quite popular in Russia, the United States, and The Netherlands. However, in the past few<br />
				decades <strong>soccer,</strong> began to gained more of a spotlight, this is inpart thanks to Canada's<br />
				increased globalization, and large number of <em>new Canadians</em> who enjoy the beutiful game.<br />
				Unlike hockey, where the barriers to entry are quite high due to the cost of the equipment. Soccer,<br />
				offers a low barrier of entry for kids.</p>
